Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
#        print(head)
        result = head
        counter = 1
        current_node = head
        # Iterate once to count the nodes
        while current_node.next != None:
            counter+=1
            current_node = current_node.next
        if counter==1:
            return result
        if counter % 2 == 0:
            for i in range(0,counter//2):
                result = result.next
            return result
        else:
            for i in range(0,counter//2):
                result = result.next
            return result


LEARNED: 
	You can trade memory for speed and ease.
	Making a list object and appending each "next" node allows you to get back to the half way point fast

NOTE: 
	[]: means list
		list is mutable, unlike strings
	You can reference the last item in a list with var[-1]
	You can append to a list with .append()
	len() returns length
	// is floor division
	% is modulo
	assign more than one at a time: var1 = var2 = 2

The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
Given an integer num, return its complement.


class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        int_2 = format(num,'b')
        output_value = ''
        for char_val in int_2:
            if char_val == '0':
                output_value += '1'
            else:
                output_value += '0'
        return int(output_value,2)
